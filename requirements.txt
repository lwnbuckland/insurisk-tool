# The following dependencies were removed to improve build compatibility:
#  - pandas: not needed; replaced by Python's built-in csv module.
#  - python-docx: not used; the risk dictionary is loaded from CSV.

# Note: rapidfuzz was previously used for fuzzy matching. To avoid native
# compilation issues on certain platforms (e.g. Python 3.13), the app now uses
# Python's built-in difflib for simple fuzzy matching, so rapidfuzz is no
# longer required.
